Must have:

Assignment title: Google Page Recreation

Installation & usage: 
-Installed express(to access express objects and methods e.g. GET, POST, DELETE), cors(to allow for server to act along multiple paths) and nodemon(for server to update automatically when changes made)

Changelog

BackEnd:
1)Got server up and running with express framework and began to create functions and define the get routes.
2)Tried to implement MVC architecture however resulted in servernot working and was a mess

FrontEnd:
1)Created basic HTML layout, using stand alone CSS to style the page- adding google image, search bar, buttons (search/ I am feeling lucky)
2)Added eventListeners to both of the buttons- so when clicked it takes you to either the search page or directly to a random search item.
3)Put in the fetch commands so the the get requests to the server were getting a response.

Bugs
-Multiple issues when trying to get fetch to work as things were coming back undefined- fixed through use of 'data'
-Imports and file paths when trying to impliment the MVC architecture.
-Struggled with bootstrap to begin with as things weren't going where we wanted them too, so converted to vanilla CSS

Could have:
-Created a back button so you can return to the search
-Added search bar on the results page to allow to conduct more searches
-Implementing the google search api (need to ask Arafath)
-Created it so when a word was typed into the input it directed you to that specific results page
